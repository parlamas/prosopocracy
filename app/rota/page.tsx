            Voting decides who governs you. It has never, by itself, meant you govern
            yourself. The case for rotation rests on five claims &mdash; each one a reason
            elections and self-rule aren&apos;t the same thing.

                  If someone holds power indefinitely &mdash; or even for a fixed multi-year

                In classical Athens, most public offices weren&apos;t won by election
                &mdash; they were filled by lottery, drawn from the pool of eligible
                citizens. Election was viewed with suspicion, reserved mainly for the few
                roles requiring specialized skill, like generalship.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reasoning was direct: elections tend to favor the wealthy, the
                well-connected, and the persuasive. A lottery favors no one. It was
                considered the more democratic mechanism &mdash; selection by lot was, in a
                real sense, the original meaning of &quot;rule by the people.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                That tradition resurfaces today in citizens&apos; assemblies in Ireland and
                France, in sortition-based reform proposals worldwide, and in a growing body
                of political theory questioning whether elections were ever democracy&apos;s
                defining feature at all.

                Standardized, mandatory training ahead of each rotation is the working
                assumption &mdash; but the scope and rigor of that training is unresolved,
                and it&apos;s the single hardest design problem in this model.

                Sortition has clear historical precedent at city scale. Scaling it to
                national governance &mdash; especially for matters requiring continuity,
                like foreign policy &mdash; is an open design question, not a solved one.
